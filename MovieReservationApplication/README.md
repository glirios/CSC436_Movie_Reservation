We have not been keeping up with the project as much as we would have liked.

After writing code for the APIs, we have found that the Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes apis that we were planning on using are no longer available for public use. The website was left available to view since public use ended in 2013. I have tried searching for other review websites, but all require a payment or some kind of proposal that will need review. We have submitted a form to rotten tomatoes who still have their API available. We are waiting to hear back, but at the moment we are looking at other alternatives.
